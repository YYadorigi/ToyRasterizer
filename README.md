# Toy Rasterizer

A handy tool for rendering 3D models into 2D images. This project is at the beginning base on the lesson 1 of the tutorial of [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer.git) and is handmadely implemented by myself. The only external library used is `eigen3` for matrix calculation.
